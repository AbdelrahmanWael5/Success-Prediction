# Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail using machine learning and neural networks. The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train multiple models from classical ML to deep learning to compare their performance.

## Data Preprocessing & Analysis

Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas

Handled missing values and prepared features

Visualized key patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Models Used
Scikit-learn Models

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Neural Network (TensorFlow)

MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) model built with TensorFlow/Keras

## Model Evaluation

Each model was evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

F1-score

A performance comparison was made to identify the best model for predicting student outcomes.

## Technologies & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras
